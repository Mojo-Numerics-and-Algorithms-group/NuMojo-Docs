# Installation

Mojo does not have a package manager yet so there are two options to install NuMojo.

## Git Clone
Use this if you are planning to contribute or if you want to see how it works under the hood.

If you are using VScode just  copy this url: https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo.git and paste.

If you use the command line run the following.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo.git
```

## Mojo Package in the Release
[Releases](https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo/releases/) contains the major versions of Numojo, just download the mojopkg file and move it to your working directory.
